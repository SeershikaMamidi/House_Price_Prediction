# Linear-Regression-Model-for-House-Price-Prediction

# Problem Statement
A real state agents want the help to predict the house price for regions in California. He gave you the dataset based on 1990 California census to work on and you decided to use Linear Regressioon Model and also test which model would 
be the best for making such predictions.

Dataset contains 10 columns and 20,640 rows with CSV extension. The data contains the following columns :
1.longitude               
2.latitude                
3.housing_median_age      
4.total_rooms             
5.total_bedrooms        
6.population             
7.households              
8.median_income           
9.median_house_value      
10.ocean_proximity         


We will be using "median_house_value" as 'y' or the dependent variable, and the rest as independent variables. For the purpose of Regression, the variable named: "ocean_proximity" with be
omitted due to its non-numerical value.
